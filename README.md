# commentBoardApp
This is a simple comment board project, as a simple NodeJs with express and Sequelize, and reactJs project

Only requirement to run this is to clone the source code, run npm i on both /api and /app directories, 
and have a running PostgreSQL instance running with an existing 'api' database
API and APP projects should both be able to run using "npm run dev", and DB schema should be generated on bootup(due to sequelize .sync() function)
